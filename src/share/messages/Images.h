// A primary challenge in designing image classes is that the need to support very efficient
// pixel operations is at odds with a desire to have an elegant, modular, polymorphic set of
// classes. The class hierarchy herein achieves a reasonable tradeoff. 
//
// At the base of the hierarchy, the abstract base class Image defines an interface to any
// image, where an image is a two-dimensional zero-based array of pixels whose size is determined
// at run time. Pixels are integer quantities that can fit in 32 bits. Pixels can be read and
// written using relatively inefficient virtual functions, and a rectangular subset ("window") of
// the image can be made in small constant time. An image can be null, having no pixels. Attempts
// to read or write outside the bounds of an image results in an assertion failure in debug mode
// and are undefined in release mode. 
//
// The pixels of an image may reside in memory or may be computed from their (x, y) coordinates
// by any suitable formula. Computed images are read-only. Other, more exotic images can be
// derived from Image. 
//
// Code that takes an image as input and is not speed-critical should be written to operate on
// Image, for maximum flexibility. 
//
// The derived template class MemoryImage<T> is the concrete base class for any image whose
// pixels, of type T, reside in memory. T is expected to be an integer type. Pixels may reside on
// the heap or in a fixed video memory. Heap pixels are managed by these classes and are
// automatically deleted when all images sharing those pixels are destroyed. 
//
// A MemoryImage supports efficient pixel operations using native C++ pointers, and supports an
// efficient window operation where the window image shares pixels with the source image and so
// can be made without copying pixels. A client cannot tell whether or not a MemoryImage is a
// window of another image, so any image processing operation on a MemoryImage will work on
// full iamges and windows alike. 
//
// A MemoryImage supports an efficient subsample operation, which makes a new MemoryImage that
// consists of every xSample pixel in x and every ySample pixel in y. The new image is made in
// small constant time without copying pixels. This is not a good way to do subsampling for use
// as an image processing operation (e.g. for resolution pyramids); instead its main purpose is
// to obtain a Y, U, or V image that is part of a YUV composite image. 
//
// Code that takes an image as input and is speed-critical should generally operate on a
// MemoryImage. This allows the code to operate on every memory image type, including the Y, U,
// and V components of a YUV image as separate images without pixel copying. 
//
// Sometimes code assumes that pixels are sequential in memory, which is called a "packed" image.
// The Y, U, and V components of a YUV image are not packed, but most other images are. The
// template class PackedImage<T> is derived from MemoryImage<T> and guarantees that the pixels
// are packed. While MemoryImage is preferred, legacy or assembly language code may assume a
// packed image and can be written to operate on PackedImage. By doing so, attempts to pass a
// potentially not packed image to one of these routines can be detected at compile time,
// avoiding the need to figure out how to handle such an error at run time. 
//
// A YUVImage is a packed image of unsigned 8-bit pixels in the YUV composite format. The Y, U,
// and V components can be extracted as MemoryImages in small constant time. The width of a YUV
// image is guaranteed to be a multiple of 4. YUVImage has special versions of window and other
// member functions that insure that windows and copies of YUV images are valid YUV images (width
// is multiple of 4, pixels in YUYV order).

// *******************

// The pixel buffer classes manage the memory that holds pixels for images whose pixels reside
// in memory. The goal is to allow images to share pixels efficiently for a variety of purposes,
// and for a buffer holding the pixels to be deleted automatically when the last image using that
// buffer is destroyed. The variety of purposes includes: 
//
//    * Making in small constant time a window (rectangular subset of some image) that shares
//      pixels with the image 
//    * Making in small constant time a subsample (an every nth pixel subset of some image) that
//      shares pixels with the image, primarily to support extracting Y, U, and V images from a
//      YUV composite
//    * Making in small constant time a copy of an image, using copy constructors or assignment
//      operators, that shares pixels with the image. This allows very efficient construction
//      and destruction of copies, which is very convenient for functions that return images,
//      and to take advantage of the full power of C++ temporary objects in expressions, which
//      have to be constructed and destroyed behind the scenes.
//
// Typically a pixel buffer resides on the heap, where these classes manage its lifetime
// automatically. A pixel buffer may also reside in memory outside the control of these classes,
// the primary example being video memory into which images are acquired from a camera. Video
// memory is managed by the acquisition system. Any memory managed by other code, video or
// otherwise, can be used as a pixel buffer as needed.
//
// The abstract base class Pixelbuffer implements functionality common to heap and video buffers
// (and any other types that one wishes to derive). The derived classes HeapPixelBuffer and
// VdeoPixelBuffer handle the two concrete cases.

// This is the abstract base class for all images that reside in memory. It is abstract because
// it doesn't implement the pure virtual functions of its base class Image. This class implements
// all of the memory image mechanism that is not dependent on the type of pixels, including all
// interface to pixel buffers. The concrete derived template class MemoryImage<T> adds just the
// mechanism that depends on the pixel type T. It is good programming style in C++ to restrict a
// template class as much as is practical to just those things that depend on the template
// parameters, putting all common mechanism in a base class. This can significantly reduce the
// amount of code generated, and provides a clearer and perhaps easier to maintain
// implementation, at a cost of some increased time up front in figuring out and implementing the
// division between the base class and the template class. Note that reducing the amount of code
// generated may not be a big deal on contemporary machines with gigabytes of memory, but it can
// also reduce instruction cache misses which can be a big deal in time-critical systems.

// It is possible in principal for a sufficiently smart compiler to split a template class
// automatically, avoiding the need for the programmer to figure out how to do it. I don't know
