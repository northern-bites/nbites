/**
 * @class IOProvider
 *
 * An abstract class that has the only role of providing means of IO through
 * a file descriptor
 *
 * On unix a file descriptor could represent anything from an actual file to
 * a socket or some shared memory stuff.
 *
 * So each child class of this class should implement some way of getting a
 * file descriptor
 *
 * Note: the IOProvider will not open the file descriptor automatically;
 * Instead, one has to call openCommunicationChannel for that to happen
