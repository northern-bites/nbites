/*
 * @class DiagramThread
 *
 * A class that holds a diagram and runs it in its own thread. Users can
 * add modules, which are added to the diagram it contains. Handles
 * all of the managing of pthreads; since portals are thread-safe, there
 * should be no further need of things like mutexes. Provides a way to log
 * any type of message from an appropriate OutPortal in this thread also.
 *
 * Update: while we don't need mutexes, we DO need to limit the frame rate
 * of each of our threads. Each thread needs to sleep for the rest of its
 * "time slice" after it has processed. This way we don't process the same
 * image twice, for example, or query naoqi over and over again for the
 * same joint angles. Also, all of our systems get a turn at the CPU.
 * all of this is handled in the private subclass of Diagram, RobotDiagram.
