### Defender
"""
Defender has three subroles: Sweeper, Center Back, and Stopper.
A Sweeper's job is to sit in front of the goal box, but off to one side slightly,
            in order to provide more coverage of the goal. Ideally we would work
            with the goalie to ensure we don't block the ball from view. Useful
            when using saving goalie rather than aggressive goalie.
A Center Back will move in a large box in front of the goalbox in support of
            the chaser. They will stay between the ball and the goal.
A Stopper will move back and forth on a line behind the center circle,
            following the ball laterally (in the Y direction), but not going too
            far toward the edge of the field.

### Offender
"""
Offender has four subroles: Forward, Striker, L/R wing, and Picker.
A Forward's job is to sit on the side of the field near the goal line on the
            opposite side of the field as the ball, both to provide support, and
            to catch a ball that was kicked out of the endline by the opposing team.
A Striker will sit on the opposite side of the field as the ball right outside the
            opponent's goalbox to provide a layup opportunity and to catch a shot
            that may have gone wide.
A L/R wing moves in a small line vertically (in the X) opposite the ball (ie. if
            the ball moves toward the opponent goal, we will move toward our own
            goal). This is to balance the offensive side of the field with the
            chaser. The Wing will also be on the opposite side of the field as
            ball.
A Picker hangs out dead center in front of the opponent goalbox waiting for a pass
            from a chaser who is in a coner. It's like a real coner-kick in soccer!

### Middie
"""
Middie has two subroles: Defensive Middie and Offensive Middie.
A Defensive Middie will move laterally with the ball just behind the center line.
            This lets us provide a foward defense and lets us retrieve balls that
            we may have kicked off the opposing endline
An Offensive Middie's job is simply the opposite of a Defensive Middie.
Currently, an Offender will transition into an Offensive Middie when the ball is
            far down on our side, and the similarly the Defender will transition
            into a Defensive Middie, since we only have three field players.
