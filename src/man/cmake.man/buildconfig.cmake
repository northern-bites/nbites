# WELCOME NBITER

#   That's enough caps.  Build configurations for Man.  Manually-set compile
#   options and flags, along with the build option definitions (use the
#   ccmake GUI to flip those on/off).
#
#   Enjoy your configuring.

############################ Configure Options
# Definitions for the CMake configurable build options.  Defined here, they
# are set at build/configure time.  Corresponding C/C++ MACRO definitions
# should reside in the [module]config.in files.  The [module]config.h headers
# will be auto-generated my cmake and dependant file recompiled after a
# build change.  Some re-configurat bugs may still need to be worked out.
#
# IF all else fails, just `make clean` and `make cross` or straight, configure
# again, and you should be set.
#

# See documentation strings for descriptions
