/**
 * This is a simple state machine that logs representations and writes them to disk.
 * It is configured using the logger.cfg which should be located somewhere inside
 * the Config directory.
 *
 * In order to be logable a representation needs a message id. If it does not have one
 * the code will not compile.
 *
 * A representation is only logable if it is registered.
 * To register a new representation add it to the initRepresentations() method
 * inside the .cpp of this class. Do NOT add an include to the representation as it is
 * not needed.
 *
 * As mentioned above this is a state machine. It consists of the following states:
 *  PRE_INITIAL: If the logger is enabled it will immediately switch the state to INITAL.
 *               If the code is running inside the simulator the logger will never leave this state.
 *  INITIAL    : General setup, representations are sorted, memory allocation etc. Switch to IDLE afterwards.
 *  IDLE       : Stays in this state until the game state is ready|set|playing then switches to RUNNING.
 *  RUNNING    : Logs every frame until the game state switches to initial|finished then switches back to IDLE
 *
 * Everything that the logger logs is written into a ring buffer. The buffer size can be configured (see logger.cfg).
 * A non-real-time thread slowly writes the data from the buffer to the disk. If the bhuman process is stopped while
 * there is still data inside the buffer that data is lost!
 *
 * Usage of the logger:
 * run() should be called once in the end of every frame.
