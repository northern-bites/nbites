Preamble: B-Human releases most of the software it uses at RoboCup
competitions to allow teams participating in the Standard Platform
League that do not have the resources to develop a complete robot
soccer system on their own, but still have important contributions
to make to the goals of RoboCup. We intend to enable such teams to 
benchmark their own scientific approaches in RoboCup competitions.
We also hope that the scientific community will benefit from their
work through the publication of their findings.
A second reason for B-Human releasing its code is that source code
is the most solid documentation of how problems were actually
solved.


Parts of this distribution were not developed by B-Human. 
This license doesn't apply to these parts, the rights of the 
copyright owners remain.

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without 
modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions 
are met:
1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright

2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above 
   copyright  notice, this list of conditions and the following 
   disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided 
   with the distribution.

3. The end-user documentation included with the redistribution, if 
   any, must include the following acknowledgment:
   "This product includes software developed by B-Human 
    (http://www.b-human.de)."
   Alternately, this acknowledgment may appear in the software 
   itself, if and wherever such third-party acknowledgments 
   normally appear.

4. If the source code or parts of the source code shall be used 
   for a RoboCup competition, the competing program must differ in 
   at least multiple major parts from the original distribution. 
   "Major parts" means own contributions to the RoboCup goal, which
   are potentially publishable and usually manifest themselves as 
   new modules (i.e. source code) and not just as a parameterization
   of existing technology (e.g. walking parameters, kicks, behavior
   options). 

5. For each B-Human code release from which parts are used in a
   RoboCup competition, the usage shall be announced in the SPL 
   mailing list (currently robocup-nao@cc.gatech.edu) one month 
   before the first competition in which you are using it. The
   announcement shall name which parts of this code are used.
   It shall also contain a description of the own contribution
   that addresses the criterions mentioned above.

6. If you are using this source code or parts of this source code
   and happen to meet members of B-Human at a RoboCup competition,
   please provide these members with a few bottles of
   your favorite beer.

7. Bug fixes regarding existing code shall be sent back to B-Human via
   GitHub pull request (https://github.com/bhuman).
