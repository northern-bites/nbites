/**
 * Possible log levels
 * When something is to be logged an associated level is passed with it. Only
 * messages with levels greater than logLevel are actually logged at runtime.
 * Levels should be set to an appropriate point, so that selecting a logLevel
 * such as INFO gives a corresponding level of logging.
 * A message is FATAL if the robot cannot function in its current state.
 * An ERROR, while still allowing a robot to run, greatly impairs its ability
 * to function accurately or as intended.
 * INFO gives useful, concise summaries of the robot's functioning.
 * VERBOSE details at length every step that INFO summarises.
 * DEBUGx gives multiple levels of debugging, for the coder's pleasure.
 * @see logLevel
