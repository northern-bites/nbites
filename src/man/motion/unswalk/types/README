This directory contains publically viewable types that are useful
across multiple modules.

What should these types contain ?
 * No dynamic memory allocation
        this will cause problems if two threads try to access
        the data simultaneously
 * Only public:'ly viewable data definitions
 * A serialisation method

Conversly, these types should not add internal data that would only
clutter the already huge amount of publically viewable information
 ie. The Blackboard
