
 FADBAD++ Templates for Automatic Differentiation
 ================================================

   FADBAD++ defines C++ templates for performing automatic differentiation
of functions implemented as C/C++ programs. Three types of automatic
differentiation has been implemented. The forward and the backward methods
are implemented to compute first order derivatives and the Taylor expansion
method is implemented to compute Taylor series expansion.
   All templates are flexible in the way that the arithmetic used in as
template-arguments can be chosen by the user. This way differentiation of 
programs, based on any arithmetic such as: double, interval, multiprecision 
etc. is possible. This flexibility also makes it possible to perform automatic
differentiation on a program which itself uses automatic differentiation.
All three methods can be mixed in an application and the user can obtain 
derivatives using the most optimal combination of methods for the application.

APPLICATIONS:

  * Forward automatic differentiation on a function f : R^n->R^n, evaluated 
    in interval arithmetics, using the BIAS/PROFIL package, to obtain function
    values and derivatives. Used with the interval Newton method to obtain 
    guarenteed enlosures of all solutions to the nonlinear equation f(x)=0.

  * Forward-Backward automatic differentiation on a function f : R^n->R, 
    evaluated in interval arithmetics, using the BIAS/PROFIL package and the 
    backward method to obtain first order derivatives (the gradient) and the 
    forward method to differentiate the first order derivatives to obtain the 
    second order derivatives (the Hessian). Used with the interval Krawczyk 
    method to perform global optimization obtaining a guarenteed enclosure of 
    the global minimum. 

  * Numerical integration of a function f : RxR^n->R, using a
    three-point-two-derivative formula. The Backward method has been used to
    differentiate the Numerical integration program obtaining the n partial 
    derivatives of the integral with respect to the n parameters in the 
    function. 

  * Taylor expansion of the solution to an ordinary differential equation, 
    used to solve initial value problems. The Forward method has been used to 
    differentiate the initial value problem solver to obtain the solution of 
    the variational problem.

  * Taylor expansion of the solution to an ordinary differential equation 
    using interval arithmetics and using the Forward method to obtain 
    derivatives of the Taylor coefficients with respect to the point of 
    expansion, which are the values of the Taylor coefficients for the 
    solution of the variational problem. Used in a method which solves initial
    value problems with guaranteed enclosures.
