/**
 * Motion is a module-level connection between all the core aspects of the
 * motion module.
 *
 * It has the following jobs:
 *  - Create a switchboard, which will select between walk engine, chop engine,
 *    etc.
 *  - Create the approriate enactor, which is the layer that communicates
 *    joint angles between the switchboard and the target platform (e.g. robot,
 *    simulator)
 *  - Instantiate a MotionInterface for PyMotion to use to communicate with
 *    Cpp motion module.
 *
 * The 'Motion' thread is really the switchboard thread (see MotionSwitchboard
 * for details). The enactor will also create its own thread, which is dependant
 * on the platform (i.e. simulator or real robot)
