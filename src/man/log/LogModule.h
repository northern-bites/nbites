/*
 * @class LogModule
 * @class LogBase
 *
 * The LogModule templated class is can take any type of message input
 * and will log it to a file. It inherits from LogBase to avoid template
 * bloat and so that we can keep lists etc of LogModules if necessary.
 * The base class provides basic IO operations and the templated class
 * specializes it for messages.
 *
 * We use AIO because it allows us to queue writes, then immediately return
 * rather than having the program block. See
 *      http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-async/
 * for a good explanation of what this means. This is why you will see
 * all of the aio calls rather than simple writes.
 *
 * Note that log files are written HEADER | SIZE | MSG | SIZE | MSG ...
 * where each SIZE gives the number of bytes in the next MSG.
