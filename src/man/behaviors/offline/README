README noggin/offline

The offline directory houses utilities for processing and creating localization logs.

Run the command "make" in this directory will create a number of usefull localization
utilities.

Currently two different executables are created "convertRobotLog" and "faker".


convertRobotLog input-file output-file

This command takes as input a dot loc file saved on the robot and outputs a dot ekf file to
that can be read by the World Controller module of the TOOL.

faker input-file

This command takes as input a dot nav file created by a human to represent a fake robot path
which is then used to create noisy landmark observations which are processed by the localization
system.  It gives as output a dot ekf and a dot mcl file with the same name as the dot nav.

Format of the navigation input file (*.nav), has one START POSITION LINE and as many
NAVIGATION LINES as required:

  # START POSITION LINE
  x-value y-value heading-value ball-x ball-y

  # NAVIGATION LINES
  deltaForward deltaLateral deltaRotation ball-vel-x ball-vel-y numFrames

When a dot ekf or dot mcl file is created from a dot nav file it has additional information
reporting the ground truth (read human created) position of the robot at all points.

When one of these files is processed by the TOOL in addition to the robot's estimated position
a known position is displayed on the field so that the two may be compared.  This ground truth
could be extended when other robot logs are created either through a known position of a
simulated robot extracted from a GPS moudle in the simulator or a known position of a real robot
taken from an overhead camera of the field.
