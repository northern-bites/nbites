# This file maintains the core functionality of a soccer player, and is included
# in the SoccerFSA by default
# When the robot is in initial, it turns on its gains, and sits down, if standing
# When the robot is in ready, it stands up and locPans
# When the robot is in set, it fixates on the ball, stops walking if walking in ready
# When the robot is in playing, it does the same as in set
# When the robot is in finish, it stops, sits down, and turns off its gains
