### BASIC IDEA
# We dribble by setting ourselves up for a dribble kick. The sweet spot
# is in front of the ball, so setting ourselves up for a kick actually
# results in us running through the ball. (There is no actual dribble sweet
# move.) If vision sees a crowded area in front of us, we rotate around the 
# ball and dribble again to space. We only dribble if shoulDribble returns 
# true, see DribbleTransitions.py for more info.
