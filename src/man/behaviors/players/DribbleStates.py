### BASIC IDEA 
# We dribble by setting ourselves up for a dribble kick. The sweet spot 
# is in front of the ball, so setting ourselves up for a kick actually
# results in us running through the ball. (There is no actual dribble sweet
# move.) If vision sees a crowded area in front of us, we rotate around the 
# ball and dribble again when we see a clear path. We only dribble if these 
# conditions are true: 1. We are positioned according to positionedForDribble. 
# 2. We are facing our opponents' goal. 3. We can see the ball close to us.

### TODO
# ballInGoalBox dribbling via goalie detection
# rotate towards goal when dribbling
# test time-left based decision making
# choose direction better, based on loc and heatmap?
# frame counter rotatation?

### DONE
# dribbleGoneBad needs work
# dribble for the score if close enough to goal
# get rid of 'dribble' state, reorganize FSA
# cross to cross dribbling
# time-left based decision making
