        automatically).

        is and the speed paramater is interpreted as the maximum speed; only affects
        the non-fast walk, since the fast walk adapts its velocities dynamically anyway.
        Don't use it the estimates to the target are good.

        walk when in the general area of our target. This allows us to ignore playbook's
