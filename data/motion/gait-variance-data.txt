	Nathan's accelerometer variance notebook

##
Data taken on 5/7 on slarti, accelerometer filtering current as of then. The 
heuristic is equal to the sum for X/Y of: (variance*WEIGHT), where the WEIGHT
for these trials was set to 50 (the value used previously in our learning).
##

UNSTABLE - Walks the wrong way when given (0, 1, 0) vector, almost falls etc.

  X/Y accelerometer variance: 0.083/0.425
  Stability heuristic for this gait: 25.3544175266

REALLY GOOD - highly stable, steady footsteps etc

  X/Y accelerometer variance: 0.035/0.169
  Stability heuristic for this gait: 10.1740243571

To make this stand out more, we may want to square the terms. Data for this
to follow. --> new heuristic = sum of X/Y (variance*WEIGHT)^2

UNSTABLE, ran it a couple times. The robot performed about as badly as
before. This time returning the square of the terms.

  X/Y accelerometer variance: 0.045/0.244
  Stability heuristic for this gait: 153.57502364

  X/Y accelerometer variance: 0.118/0.347
  Stability heuristic for this gait: 335.440689578

  X/Y accelerometer variance: 0.128/0.861
  Stability heuristic for this gait: 1894.44798416

  X/Y accelerometer variance: 0.043/0.224
  Stability heuristic for this gait: 130.059702832

STABLE again, with the squaring of the variance terms

  X/Y accelerometer variance: 0.058/0.079
  Stability heuristic for this gait: 23.8473145554

  X/Y accelerometer variance: 0.068/0.041
  Stability heuristic for this gait: 15.7639944417

  This trial was less stable than the first two, but still more stable
  than the UNSTABLE category trials

  X/Y accelerometer variance: 0.031/0.140
  Stability heuristic for this gait: 51.2414201526

Squaring the variance terms greatly helped differentiate the two gaits. I'm
going to incorporate this into the walk learning heuristic. Especially once gaits
get to the point that they all stand for an equal amount of time, this ought to
help us tell which ones are the most stable.

##
Data taken 5/9, on slarti again for consistency's sake. Robot remained stationary
for 30 seconds, and reported accelerometer variance afterwards.
