* CURRENT BUGS & ISSUES

** Motion

*** TODO Gait switching interface
    Needs to be moved into more sensible location in Python and its interface needs to be rethought. How we do it now is unsustainable and bug-inviting. Possible gait FSA?

*** TODO Goalie issues

**** TODO Correct switching from squatting to squatted

**** TODO Correctly use spin find ball and chasing.

** Vision

** Localization

** Behaviors

*** TODO Fix stopping during approachBall, should never setSpeed(0,0,0) during approach or goTo

** Misc.

*** TODO Comment code
    Tucker: Localization, comm
    Joho: Motion
    Chown: Vision?
*** TODO Get more people. duh.

* NEW FEATURES
** High Level and biggest goals
   1. Significantly better localization
      * This entails improvements in a few places (vision, Kalman filter). Will allow for improvements in positioning and kick decisions.
   2. Kick engine
      * Omni-directional and distance varying kicks
   3. Precise stepping and stopping
      * More accurate positioning before kicks.
   4. Integrate previous components into behaviors

** Motion

*** Walking
**** TODO Move each gait into a separte file
     All gaits get separate file, in a folder called motiuon/gaits
**** TODO Better Webots gait

**** TODO Faster stopping
     Decouple Step creation and ZMP generation
**** TODO Walking interface to Python to move a certain distance & angle

**** TODO Fix/Dehack how walk engine does turning steps

**** TODO Make hip offsets variable, so we can widen stance of robot

**** TODO Rearchitecutre Walking (see details)
***** TODO Move more complexity out of step generator
      And into Controller/WalkingLeg, and make Step Gen really just a glorified list
***** TODO Movable steps

***** TODO ZMP recalculated after each frame depending on new steps

**** TODO Figure out a better way to use angleXY as sensor feedback
**** TODO Clean out MotionInterface of unused functions
*** Kicking

**** TODO [#B] Kick engine
     Needs adjustable resultant distances and angles. Dynamic depending on ball placement.
     Inverse kinematics plus COM-Control.

*** Head
**** TODO Look-To RelX, RelY in the HeadProvider

*** Misc motion

**** TODO Rapid spinning

** RoboGuardian
*** Implement NUBot esque fall positions
** Vision
*** TODO Opponent recognition (also with sonar)
*** TODO Open goal detection
*** TODO Improve lines

** Localization

*** TODO Improve Kalman filter
**** Investigate using unscented or multi-modal filter
**** TODO Improve handling of unexpected observations
     Could turn it off or use a counter for when to use observations again.
**** TODO Move from boost/UBLAS to the Eigen matrix library.
*** TODO Do ball covariance differently
*** TODO Investigate sensor based odometry
*** TODO Topological localization
*** TODO Teammate localization
*** TODO Opponent localization

** Behaviors

*** TODO [#A] Replace hand coded kick decision with computational best kick choice.

*** TODO [#A] Python kick objects.
    Objects store kick characteristics like distance, angle, and total move time.
*** TODO [#A] Kick objectives define high level desired ball placement.
    E.g. "in their goal", "opponent side of the field", "in front of my teammate"
*** TODO [#A] Improve positioning on ball before kick.
    Choose kick before stopping, then position accordingly.
*** TODO [#B] Better shot aiming
    First, aim where they're likely to not be. Then, add in shot detection.

*** TODO Goalie positioning

*** TODO Goalie saves (that do not harm the robot, preferably)
    e.g. kick leg out when ball is close enough, or at least a gentle dive.

*** TODO Fall protection, a la NuBots.
    Keep detection in C++, but increase its robustness and add Python mid-fall response.

*** TODO Smarter and faster panning, ball searching
    Don't look of the field, face the field

*** TODO Re-implement Aibo role selection as per NBites paper on subject

*** TODO Work out 3 robot deployment strategy

*** TODO Passing

*** TODO Monitor robot stability online:
    (maybe by amplitude of aX/aY oscillation),
    and potentially have behaviors react when this oscillation becomes too large
** Tools

*** TOOL

**** TODO Classifier.

*** Trac

**** TODO Use tickets more to manage team workflow

*** Other

**** Burst tools
     Check out the burst tools and adapt them to our needs. Possibly write integrate into
     TOOL.
